<p>Unlike many&nbsp;<a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters">natural disasters</a>, most&nbsp;<a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/wildfires/">wildfires</a>&nbsp;are caused by people&mdash;and can be prevented by people, too. Meteorologists are not yet able to forecast wildfire outbreaks, so people in fire-prone areas should plan ahead and prepare to evacuate with little notice. Here are some tips on how to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/">prevent wildfires</a>&nbsp;and what to do if you're&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/features/how-to-survive-natural-disaster-storm-hurricane-expert-tips/">caught in the middle</a>&nbsp;of one.</p>

<div class="parbase smartbody section text">
<ul>
<li>Contact 911, your local fire department, or the park service if you notice an unattended or out-of-control fire.</li>
<li>Never leave a fire unattended. Completely extinguish the fire&mdash;by dousing it with water and stirring the ashes until cold&mdash;before sleeping or leaving the campsite.</li>
<li>When camping, take care when using and fueling lanterns, stoves, and heaters. Make sure lighting and heating devices are cool before refueling. Avoid spilling flammable liquids and store fuel away from appliances.</li>
<li>Do not discard cigarettes, matches, and smoking materials from moving vehicles, or anywhere on park grounds. Be certain to completely extinguish cigarettes before disposing of them.</li>
<li>Follow local ordinances when burning yard waste. Avoid backyard burning in windy conditions, and keep a shovel, water, and fire retardant nearby to keep fires in check. Remove all&nbsp;<a href="http://www.esfd.org/index.php/facts-and-safety-tips/fire-safety/flammable-substances-facts-tips">flammables</a>&nbsp;from yard when burning.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #33cccc;"><strong>If Caught in a Wildfire</strong></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="parbase smartbody section text">
<ul>
<li>Don't try to outrun the blaze. Instead, look for a body of water such as a pond or river to crouch in.</li>
<li>If there is no water nearby, find a depressed, cleared area with little vegetation, lie low to the ground, and cover your body with wet clothing, a blanket, or soil. Stay low and covered until the fire passes.</li>
<li>Protect your lungs by breathing air closest to the ground, through a moist cloth, if possible, to avoid inhaling smoke.</li>
</ul>
